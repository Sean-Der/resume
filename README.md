resume
=========

Minimal resume I made with LaTeX

* HTML Example: http://siobud.com/resume
* PDF Example: http://siobud.com/resume/resume.pdf

#Libraries and tools used
* TeX Live: http://www.tug.org/texlive/
* LaTeX Resume Class: http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/


#Setup

##TeX Live
To install TeX Live in Debian pull in (texlive-latex-recommended, texlive-latex-base)

##Generate PDF
run (pdflatex resume.tex)

##Generate HTML
To generate HTML I used https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX

If you need help installing this feel free to email me. It was a pain
to setup in Debian, but was worth it. I might make a little guide
on how to install it if anyone cares
